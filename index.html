									<h3>Some Work Samples</h3>
									<p>Welcome to my portfolio section where I showcase some of my work samples in data analytics and visualization. Due to the nature of confidentiality, some of the samples have been edited to reflect a different dataset, but the techniques and tools used remain the same. Through various tools and platforms such as Python in Google Colab, spreadsheet dashboarding, PowerBI, ArcGIS, and infographics, I am able to provide valuable insights and compelling visual representations of complex data. In this section, you will find examples of my work, including a project on identifying potential new school lands using ArcGIS and conducting analyses on vector and raster data. Additionally, you will see my proficiency in programming languages such as Python, as well as my ability to create informative and visually appealing infographics on data related to people with disabilities (PWDs)</p>
